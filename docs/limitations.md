# Limitations
#### 1. Budget
Since we do not have financing, our group has to spend more effort for problem-solving. 
We cannot use certain paid tools or resources that could improve our application. 
This can also slow down the development process.

#### 2. Team size
Our team consists only of five people. Each team member is responsible for different task in application development process.

Working in such a small team might create problems with the distribution of tasks and responsibilities, 
especially if the distribution of skills and experience is unequal.

#### 3. Skills and experience
Given that this is a university project, we have team members with limited experience and skills. 
This can cause problems with the quality of work, the effectiveness of communication and the speed of completing tasks.

#### 4. Time
This is one of the main limitations, because our team is working on a project parallel with studying in the university
and having full-time jobs. Having very limited amount of time to work on a project can slow down the development and implementation of tasks.

#### 5. Testing and debugging
A small budget and limited resources can reduce the ability to thoroughly test and debug the application, 
which can lead to problems with quality and stability.

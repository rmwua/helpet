# STEEPLE analysis

This acronym encompasses some of the main factors related to the business analysis of the project. Sometimes it is referred to as PESTLE or even shorter PEST analysis. It can be understood as a framework of environmental factors for strategic management, a means to analyze the competition and place the solution in a space [[1]]. In the topics below, each element will be detailed according to this project.

## Society
> Analyses changes in culture, different demographics, and people's attitudes.

One side effect of the recent lockdowns is the increase in the number of people that have adopted animals and so are considered pet owners [[2]]. This relates directly to the current project, where not only long-time owners but also recent adopters will need a service similar to the one being proposed.
After the pandemic situation settled, and people are getting more confident to travel, their pets can become a trip partner . There are also broader pet friendly spaces everywhere, from parks to restaurants, to touristic attractions [[3]]. With more people traveling with their pets, more information is needed as to what are the veterinarian requirements, such as vaccination shots and certifications. Here again there is the opportunity to bring quality information integrated into the solution.

## Technological
> Technology changes quickly and solutions need to be adaptive.

Nowadays, it is observed a tremendous smartphone dependency from people of all ages. Notorious processes are transitioned from manual paper sheets, agendas, notepads to handheld devices [[6]]. In that regard, data synchronization across different devices must be a priority.
There is also a good opportunity to provide a notification channel for the players on this process, which can include push, email, SMS.

## Economic
> Analyses the financial implications of people's decisions.

For this topic, the initial proposition is a free to use management system, to get people's use and feel over the application, and evaluate the reach. Ads and a pro version can be later tagged as a revenue option in case there is a relevant and positive spread [[4]].
This can be continually assessed and evolved, given the future client range, and beta tests can be conducted with a subset of stakeholders.

## Environmental
> Analyses climate change and human impact in general.

This project does not oversee great influence or side effects on environmental matters. It is true, though, that this might save paper, where medical notes can be digital. Also, the team can pledge to use modern cloud providers that have environmental commitments.

## Political
> Analyses the labor laws and observes changes in taxation.

All the country's regulations are specific and must be revisited prior to committing to such a project, given the global nature of this business. Afterall, pets and pet owners are on every single country. However, the animal's medical records might not be validated by every institution [[5]].
Thus, a thorough disclaimer should be written and continually surveyed, indicating that all information provided has a said source. This source can either be fed in a crowd source fashion, or specific veterinarians can be invited to give their remarks.

## Legal
> Keep data safe and adhere to State and federal laws.

Data is the richest asset of this century. With that being said, there might be an inspection of the reference data protection and retention policies across different markets [[7]]. The result of this research will lead to policies over how to manage user information and data storage.
For example, strategize servers and points of access around the globe and architect a data isolation plan to keep multiple tenant information segregated.

## Ethical
> Not just the legal ramifications, but ethics in all the processes.

This project aims to bring trust to pet owners in terms of the defined application scope. However, there is no intention of disrupting the current operations of veterinarians and their relation to clients. It might otherwise be a complimentary tool with a constant evaluation of the uses and potential misuses in terms of ethics.

# SWOT analysis

Similar to the process described above, this section aims to assess the product within a given space, considering internal and external origins, favorable and unfavorable scenarios. This will be done using the SWOT analysis, a simple yet commonly used framework with four well defined areas [[8]].

## Strengths

The team is widely collocated with travel experience to multiple areas of the world, allowing for a multidisciplinary look into the scope.
In addition to that, some team members have pets, take them to the vets and understand the specifics about traveling with them.
Another strength is the technical skills related to the Software Development Lifecycle.

## Weakness

The project might lack team engagement since the time zones are very distinct. Even spot regular team meetings can be difficult since there is a wide difference in geographical regions.
Another potential weakness is the technology stack adopted that might need upskilling. This should be constantly evaluated and adjusted if needed and considering small development impact.

## Opportunities

As highlighted on the external environment analysis section, it is evident that pet owners and pet travel are growing considerably after the pandemics [[9]].
Also, this is a technological proposition that can be made available worldwide, thus not bound to specific markets, regions of languages.

## Threats

The biggest threat to this proposition is the limited time and short due dates. Of course, it can be continued after an initial push, but the team will have shifted priorities on different subjects.
Another one is the lack of user research that might be the motive for a product low on user engagement. It might be difficult to revolutionize the way pet care is done today.

# Assumptions Testing

To better understand in which direction to develop our app, we conducted, together with all the other types of research, a user survey, so that we could understand whether our idea to develop a pet companion app was a good one and if and what other functionalities we could add to it.

By initially describing our proposed app to users that took the survey with the following header:**”Our team is working on a mobile app that lets users keep track of their pet medical records and basic informations(name, gender, age, etc.) alongside showing them all the requirements needed to bring their animal friend(s) on their travels.”** we provided a basis from where the users would answer the follow-up questions.

## Initial question

Thankfully, almost all of the users were in favour of using a pet companion app with those characteristics we described, so we were already halfway through the hard work.


One might argue that the responses pool is not big enough, but as it is unethical and even illegal to force people to take part in surveys, we are happy with the results we had.
Also the limited time we had limited us on how long to gather survey results, so that is more than sufficient.

## Questions on functionality

We then moved the focus on the main feature that would interest potential users with the following question:**”What is the one main feature that would interest you more in this app?”**.
The results were not surprising, in a sense, and we will talk about them below the related figure.

As the main purpose of applications is to store related data, it is not surprising that the majority of users chose the second option, showing that they greatly care about storing their pets’ data in a place that is both accessible and secure.

While some would argue that our pets’ health is more important, others definitely rely more on their veterinarians to help them with that topic, therefore we should not be surprised when the second option is related to the travel-helper functionality of our app.

Such a tool would be very helpful for every pet owner during travels and even trips abroad.
These results do not mean that we will overlook the development of the health tracking functionality for our pets.


Next, we asked our potential users what additional functionalities they would have liked to have in our app, by asking the following question:**”What other functionalities would you like to have in it?”**.
We then presented our users with four different additional functionalities, and these were the results:

Users were allowed to select more than one option, and we can see that the majority of them chose functionalities more related to the travelling side of our app, letting us think that  the activities tracker might come in second place when deciding on whether to implement extra functionalities.
These extra tools will be implemented if and when we manage with our development schedule, so it was just a question to have a clearer idea on how we could proceed after developing the base app.

## Technical questions

In the next topic of the survey we decided to ask two questions about our users hardware, as we planned to develop a mobile application but wanted to test whether users would be inclined to also utilise it on other types of hardware.
To the question:**”What OS does your smartphone run on?”** we received an even result:

Which just means that our app will have to be available on both the Apple and Google store.
Users had the option to add other OSs, but no different choices were selected; even if this result shows that the two major OSs are still Android and iOS, it does not exactly mirror the actual distribution of mobile OSs in the World[1], but this can be attributed to the small pool of participants.


Next, we asked participants on which other devices they would want to use our app:**”On what other devices would you like to have this app?”**.
This was an optional question, as we are most likely going to plan this app in a responsive way, so that it will adapt to different screen sizes, but nevertheless, the results were not disappointing:

Users also had the option to write their own choice of hardware, but as results show, we can safely assume that it was a good idea to focus our attention on developing a mobile,as in, easily portable, application.
It does indeed make sense to have an app used for travels and while on visits to veterinarians, for example, to be easily accessible on portable devices.

## Financial questions

Lastly, we asked our potential users a couple of questions on the possible monetization plan of our app, as every developer would like to know how much their work is worth.
We started with the following question:**”Would you use this app even if it had ad banners?”**.
The results we had counted up to an unanimous 100%:

This shows that users do not mind ad banners in their favourite apps(we plan ours to be one of them).
Clearly, we will make sure that, if we are going to implement them, those ad banners will not in any way interfere with the full functionalities of our app.
Those will be based on users preferences and will be implemented in the most ethical and safe way possible.
The related details will be discussed during our meetings when we will be in the development phase.



The last finances related question is closely related to the previous one, and it shows that we have some playing field regarding this topic.

To the question:**”Would you pay a fee for an ad-free version?”**, the results were split in half, hence the freedom we have regarding the way we could monetize this app.

Clearly, not everyone is happy to pay for a product, so it makes sense that half of the participants answered “No” to the question.

Obvious considerations aside, it is interesting to see that all the users inclined to pay would prefer to just pay the software once instead of a monthly(or even yearly) fee, which would be more convenient in the short term, if it was perhaps needed just for a limited amount of time.

It does make sense that pet owners plan to care for their pets for a long time, as they might also have multiple pets, so this result is not totally unexpected.

## Open Question
Our last question was an empty field where users could tell us their suggestions and opinions on our apps, as we invited them with:**”If you have any other suggestions for us, please feel free to write them below!”**.

We only received two answers, one of them suggesting to add the possibility to “Track our pets’ medical records” which we already planned as one of our core functionalities, and the second and last suggestion was to just develop a responsive web interface that would cover all devices and OSs, and this is something that we will most likely work on.

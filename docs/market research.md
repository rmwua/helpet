# Market research

Regarding the market research related to our project, we have found different mobile apps that cover this particular product niche to some degree of the functionalities that we plan to implement.

The majority of them offer  pet owners the possibility to get in contact with their veterinarians and keep track of appointments, important visits, and also lets them store their pets' medical records, for example applications like PetDesk[1], or 11pets[2].
These two do not offer the possibility to check for travel regulations, unlike another app, BringFido[3], which is specialised on the travelling part of our lives with pets.

As can be seen by some of the example apps that we will analyse, this market is very promising and can be profitable in a short-to-medium term, as many of these apps are relatively young but are already exhibiting a good turnover.

# 11Pets

This first app is more focused on the client's side, as it lets pet owners store all their pets' information, but is also used by pet groomers, animal welfare organisations, and lastly pet products retailers, which have with this app a platform to advertise their activity and keep in touch with their clients.

Owners can store and share their pets' information with their veterinarians and/or groomers through the app, which also comes in handy when an urgent visit is needed.

Owners can plan and record activities and visits for their pets as well. 
The app will then send reminders about suggested activities and visits that the pets should get, based on the details of each one of them and when those activities/visits were last made.


This app uses a subscription-based monetary plan, which ranges from €50 (reduced price for new users) to €69 a month. A one-time lifetime subscription fee, which is set at €55, was also recently introduced. With a turnover between $1.0M - $2.0M , this app has a decent profit, considering that it was founded only in 2015.

# PetDesk

PetDesk offers a wide range of tools to keep a veterinarian in touch with all their clients.
The difference between our product and this app though, is that it is mainly clinic-centred, in so far that it is used by clinics, which in turn get all the necessary tools to keep in touch with their clients, i.e. via emails, automated reminders, and even a loyalty program. 

They can then suggest to their clients to download the homonym mobile app, so that pet owners can then have easy access to all their pets' details, and this is where our apps are similar.

Although the aforementioned could be one way to discover the PetDesk mobile app, it is worthy to note that this process works in the opposite way as well; through the mobile app, possible clients can find out if vet clinics offer the PetDesk service.

The app lets pet owners store their pets' medical records, set reminders for all the eventual visits and also keep in touch with their veterinarians and/or carers.

While our app would let a pet owner store their pets' medical and general information in it, it wouldn't be used by service providers like clinics.

It must be noted that, while the app is free for pet owners, clinics pay a substantial fee, $249(~£197) a month to use the software; it is no surprise then, that in 2023 it reached a revenue of $15.1 million[4].

# BringFido

BringFido is the leading app when it comes to gaining precious insights on our travel destinations related to our pets well-being. It offers users the functionality to check what their pets need in terms of documentation to travel to each country, be it, for example, the Pet passport[5] for European citizens bringing their pets abroad or other types of documentation provided by their country of origin. 

Its structure is similar to TripAdvisor, in the sense that users and service providers can share posts, reviews and pictures about places, activities and events taking part all around the globe which can be interesting for pets and their owners.

It shows a complementary list of restaurants and other locations that accept pets, events centred around them, activities that pet owners can take part in with their pets, and so on; additionally, the app also lets users book hotels for them and their pets 

It also has a section dedicated to all the legal ramifications of pet travel, from checking the travel documentation needed(as specified before) to offering pet insurance.

It does not offer the chance to store the user's pet's medical or even general records, but users can look for veterinarians and pet groomers based on location search, and for many more activities by using filters related to number, size and type of pets and so on.

# DogLog


This final app, DogLog[6], offers many of the functionalities that characterise these pet companion apps, such as the possibility to store your pets’ data and medical records, plan and note down activities and various events that happened to your pets, and so on.

One interesting functionality is that it analyses the data logged so that users can understand the trends that their pets are developing, which in turn helps owners to fine-tune their dogs’’ care routine.
All the dog’s details can be shared with other relevant figures in the user’s dog's life, like veterinarians and groomers, among others.

Users can upload pictures of their dogs to also keep a diary of them and a record of all the moments of their lives.

This app was developed by a fairly small team, so it is a good sign for an app that could be developed by a relatively small team like ours.

# Our app project - HelPet

Our application tries to incorporate almost all the functionalities of the different pieces of software taken into consideration, and simplify them into a single, easy-to-use portable app. Although it will not be used by service providers like some of the apps we analysed, it will still be a powerful and helpful tool for pet owners.
Having all your pets' medical records, being able to set reminders for visits and activities you want to take part in with your pets are sure to be welcome functionalities for every pet owner.

Adding a section with easy-to-access information about all the travel regulations regarding pets and their transport to different countries will also be very valued by users.

To summarise, although our app will not specialise itself in one of the different areas related to pets’ care, be it focusing on travel suggestions or only on analysing their medical history, it will instead try to offer a simple yet robust package of tools that will help every owner with their pets' lives, both while at home and abroad.

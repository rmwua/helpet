# Performance analysis

## Foreword
In the fourth week of Agile Software Projects our team started to communicate with one another by creating a Slack channel, which we have used as an instant communication tool since then.
Even though the gathering of team members was slow at first and we encountered some difficulties in assigning tasks to each one of us because of that, we managed to gather the full team in time to fully proceed with our work.
We then planned a first “visual” meet-up via Google Meets to talk about our ideas on this project and to know a bit more about each other, our backgrounds, our skills, and how we could best contribute to the team and to a successful application.

Ultimately we progressed to hold these meetings each week, and we will most likely keep holding them for the whole duration of this project, as they are the ideal way to inform our colleagues of our progress with our tasks.
These meetings are not mandatory, as we can keep in touch with one another on Slack, and there have been instances when one or more of our team members could not participate, and we provided keynotes and highlights of these meetings on our Slack channel.



## First meeting - Introductions and Groundwork
During the first meeting, the basic milestones for our project were discussed, we agreed to gather ideas for what our app could be, and we defined some of the tech that we would use to create our piece of software. Python was chosen as the main language with which we would program the app, and we decided to bring ideas for the app concept in the subsequent week.

In the following days a spreadsheet was created on Google Sheets so that we could find the best time to host our meetings, as each member of our team lives in different time zones, and finding an adequate time for each one of us would be a challenge without knowing beforehand.
Our team members proceeded to fill out the sheet, and a general time for our team calls was chosen(11 GMT).





## Second meeting – Project Proposal

During the second meeting, we presented our ideas for the app to the team, and the following concepts were proposed:
1. ChatGPT based character generator
2. Vet clinics CRUD web app
3. AI based video game
4. ChatGPT plugin


To choose the app we would develop, we held a vote on our Slack channel, and the second choice, the “Vet clinics CRUD web app” was selected. This was also influenced by the time our team has at its disposal, and by the different levels of experience that our team members have. If the situation would have been different, as in, if we had more time and experience another option would have probably been chosen.
The main repository for our project was created on GitHub by one of our team members and we were all invited in it so that we could contribute by adding new documents and files to it, comment on our progress and give suggestions and/or opinions on the work of our teammates.

We also encountered our first roadblock after this meeting, which consisted in the fact that our team members were not really used to GitHub as a project management system, and we had to learn about it and keep practising to increase our familiarity with it.
GitHub was used to also assign tasks to each one of us and define a schedule plan for all the different stages of development.

## Third meeting – Project development and initial research

In this third meeting we managed to gather every team member for the first time at the same time, and everyone was brought up to speed on our project. We discussed the progress we made so far with our planning  and we gathered proposals for more tech we would use for the front-end environment. 
Four different CSS engines were proposed:
1. Bootstrap
2. Tailwind
3. Material
4. Bulma
   
Team members would have a week to consider each one and choose which one they would like to work with.
During this meeting the issue of naming our app was also brought up, and we gathered ideas for its name in the following days; a vote was held on Slack to choose it, and we decided for the name “HelPet”, as it encompasses perfectly the main goal of our application.
The core scope of the application was also further refined, and we decided to focus more on the pet-owners side, as it would have been too time consuming to develop an app that would have had all the functionalities we had initially in mind for our app. This does not preclude the possibility that, if we will manage to develop the basic features of the app, we will not further extend it, on the contrary, if our schedule proceeds as intended we will probably be able to integrate more functionalities in our project.
We also discussed about the initial market research done by one of our members, and we found out that the market for pet helper apps is thriving and with many different applications that either focus on the different aspects of our pets' lives or try to offer an all-around package of functionalities to give more tools to pet owners and other related stakeholders.
This was further confirmed by our SWOT and STEEPLE analysis, which, if taken singularly, often fail to provide a precise picture of the best strategy to follow while developing a project.
Indeed, as they both have a hierarchical structure and their individual sections often do not overlap between one another, they fail to provide a wider view into the intricacies of software development, therefore,
The fact that these analyses and the market research were led by different team members provided a better outcome of the whole research, as it at least excluded some bias that would have probably emerged if all of the research would have been conducted by a single individual.
By subdividing the research work to multiple members, we managed to get a clearer and wider picture of the product we would develop, the measures to implement and the issues that we could encounter during the various aspects of our app's development and how to better solve them.

We also discussed the emergence of a possible “competitor” in the current module, as there is at least another team developing a pet-centred app, but we quickly concluded that their scope was different, and that we would focus on other functionalities than theirs.

A prototype was also proposed and was agreed on by every teammate, as it looked user-friendly and in line with the results of our research.

A survey to gather data regarding the intended functionalities of our app was conducted after this meeting, and we used the resulting data to further refine our development.

## Fourth Meeting - Progress assessment

In the fourth meeting we discussed the latest additions and modifications to the GitHub repository, some tasks were reassigned and we planned our future development stages.

In the following days we discussed the possible ethical and legal ramifications of some functionalities we planned to implement, more specifically the possible dangers that could come from implementing a veterinary LLM chatbot.


## Fifth Meeting - Progress assessment

In the fifth meeting we talked about our tasks and the next steps that we would take to complete them.
A document was created on Google Docs so that each one of us could start to port their own work in it, as to have an easier platform to work on in parallel with our GitHub repository.



## Sixth meeting – Project assessment and finalisation 

During the sixth meeting, we finalised the whole package of technical software we would use for the app development, ultimately choosing Material as design template, Angular as frontend framework, and Django as backend package. 
We discussed the completed parts of our Google Docs document, which will also be the one we will submit, and gave suggestions to better present our work in both a more professional and orderly manner.
The survey results were also discussed, which confirmed our development idea and, in concomitance with our market research, the general layout of our prototype, which we then decided to utilise.
A high fidelity prototype was created on Figma.com, and was agreed upon by the team.

# Future meetings and Conclusions

While the requirements and research gathering period might be over with the submission of our project proposal, we will most certainly keep meeting via Google Meets to keep track of our progress, while also working on our GitHub repository and talk to each other via Slack.
Our app layout and functionalities might also vary depending on how our schedule will proceed, but we are now more prepared and with enough research behind us to have a solid base from where to start.
We do not exclude the possibility that we will conduct more surveys in the future to possibly fine-tune some functionalities that were agreed upon, or to simply ask for users’ input on how the app will look and feel at certain stages of development.
This will have to fit inside our planned development phases and also our team members' schedules, which naturally vary immensely, given the different time zones and different lives.
Our planning will most likely be tailored around that, and we will utilise the aforementioned tools(Slack, Google software suite, GitHub) to carry it out as best as we can. 
To conclude, we can agree that working on this project has made especially the less experienced members - but not limited to - of our team realise how wide and intricate the work behind software development is. It has made us adapt to our team members needs and abilities, and maybe polished or even brought out new skills that each one of us had.
Our project has been in constant development and polishing done by each one of us; every bit of research that we conducted was used to further refine our scope and our idea of what we would develop, without ever losing sight of the ethics of developing an app, both on the final customer’s side but also on our team members’ side.

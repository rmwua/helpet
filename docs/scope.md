# Scope

### What is going to be implemented:

#### User Authentication
A secure login and registration system for handling user sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery processes, 
ensuring authorized access and secure management of user data.

#### Profiles of pets.
Create an individual profile for each pet with main basic information as:
name, kind of animal, breed, birthdate, weight, microchip number and special needs. 
Users can also upload photos of their pets

#### Main profile and menu navigation.
Access to list of all existing pets of the user, creation of new pet profiles.
Access to user settings through menu.

#### Medical records.
Maintain and organize medical records such as medical history, test results, examination results,
vaccination list, medications and recommendations of a veterinarian and other records.

#### Schedule and reminders
Create events for regular vet visits, vaccinations, medications and suggestions for care, grooming and any other pet-related activity.

#### Travel information (suggest to merge with chat bot) 

Find information about pet travel to different countries, such as vaccination requirements etc)

#### Notes
Create, edit and store notes.

#### LLM bot
Get assistance in searching for travel information,finding nearest vets or pet stores, and answering vet-related questions.


### What is going to be excluded:
#### Activity and feeding tracker.
Reasons:
Limited time and lack of people. Since the team is working on this project is limited to five people and has strict deadline, 
it's left with insufficient time to develop and test additional features such as food and activity tracking.
#### Social interaction.
Due to the limited resources, the team may not be able to develop a section where users can interact with other pet owners.
#### GPS tracking.
Integrating GPS tracking for pets would require additional resources, technical skills and potential privacy concerns.

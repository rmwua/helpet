# Technologies to be used in this app:

Amongst the diverse existing technologies, the chosen stack lies on a set that is either familiar to some teammates or is fit for the purpose of this project. Here is the proposed list of the full-stack platforms and frameworks utilized.

#### Frontend
A great choice in terms of visual development nowadays is to rely on responsive templates that can adapt to different screen sizes. The adopted option here is Material Design by Google. It has a set of guidelines, built-in components, and reference available [[1]].
And empowering the client-side code, Angular will be used as the front-end framework. It not only packs a complete development kit, but also has a native Material library, facilitating the templating work [[2]].

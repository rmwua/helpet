# Aims and objectives

Our team has two aims for this project:

1. Build an application that allows pet owners to improve their experience owning a pet, from storing their pets data to finding information about travel legislation and more.
2. Learn to organize a development process and deliver an actual software product.

Those aims intended to be achieved with the following set of objectives:

1. Organize a development environment for our project
2. Plan our work and make a timetable to track the progress
3. Distribute work among the team, according to the expertise and personal preference
4. Implement our project according to the plan, with necessary adjustments to the process
5. Document the project progress for the report during all the course, highlighting the decisions made and how
   exactly they were made.

As result, we should have a working and tested web application that went through thorough research and
elicitation of requirements. We also should have a report describing our path from the formal introduction
to the delivered software.

# Approach

Following Agile and User-Centered design practices, we employed [user-stories][user-stories] to describe functional
requirements of the application.

We employed the following information sources during the planning:

- Our teammate, as the originator of idea for the app, had specific needs as pet owner that could be addressed. 
She took a role of product owner for our app and drafted out initial user stories
- We performed an exhaustive and thorough marketing research of the general needs of pet owners and reviewed
the analogs and competitors of our app
- We gathered a feedback from stakeholders via surveys, in order to identify key needs and check if we addressed
them correctly in our prototypes

Due to the iterative nature of our tasks, we chose the Scrum Sprints model to be flexible in our changes and tasks
at hand. The implementation will also follow this model, allowing as to adjust our specification according to the 
course of implementation and issues that may arise.
